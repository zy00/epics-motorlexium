## configure IP address
    default mdrive ip is 192.168.33.1. Note there is no way to reset IP, once changed, label the motor with ip addr.
* Install mdrive interface software LMD software suite (windows) downloaded from URL https://novantaims.com/dloads/user-interface-software/
* Launch windows software. chose adapter interface 192.168.33.x as configured, connect to 192.168.33.1 port 503, connect 
* Newones come with CSE mark, asking to set passwd. - set up your password, and save it somewhere.  
* Disable Security  (Edit->Cyber Security Disable). It disconnects to motor, "connect" again
* Click on Mac Address "Read"/ReadAll, you should see mac and ip address existed in the controller.
* now change to new ip address/subnet mask/gateway, click on "write" on each item
* Reset driver. Connect to new IP, and double-check new ip/mask/gateway settings

## Configure Communication settings:
* set echo mode to 2  # see Mcode manual 5-41
                      # otherwise all commands would not respond - readback 0 all the time
    EM=2                  
    PR EM       

## Configure Limits connection
* hardware set up: at NSLS-II, we use: input2 = Limit+,  input3 = limit-

connections: P2a
pin 1a = input ref (connect to v+)
pin 3a = in2       (LIMIT PLUS)
pin 4a = in3       (LIMIT MINUS)
Limit common to v-
[Reason of not using IN1 is that NEMA17 (LMDxE42.IP20.pdf, pg49, 6.3.3) has Pin2a N/C]

* in windows program, set up limit inputs using ascii commands:
IS = 2, 2, 1
IS = 3, 3, 1 
(this is activate Limit when open).
IS command syntax: 
    IS input IOfunction InputActiveResponse
       input = 1,2,3,4 etc
       IOfunction: 0/generalpurpose; 1/Homing; 2/Limit+; 3/Limit-; see manual MCode_LMM.pdf 5-66 5.1.64 IS <1-4>

driver will read "PR IS" response to determine which inputs are the limits

## For encoder feedback ops (LMDAE models)
to close loop inside the controller, using hMT technology, set

AS=1;
MRES is the openloop resolution; 51200cts/rev  (256*20)
Note that Encoder is 1000 lines /rev => 4000 cts/rev
But MRES is still using openloop resolution 51200 cts/rev

Or can use AS=2 (variable current)
DO NOT use AS=3, otherwise motor keeps running


## Save to flash with command "S"

## once ioc starts,  If disconnect motor/controller power, it takes about 20s to re-establish the connection - controller reboot. Asyn autoconnect works.  For "absolute encoder models - with capacitor to save position, it will recover to the old position; For non-absolute models, readback position is zero - in this case, it would be good to set autoconnect to no, and restart IOC manually.


## Running and  Holding current

Running Current:  RC=25 (default, 25%), change:  RC=50  PR RC   S
Holding Current:  HC=5 (default 5%), to change: HC=10 PR HC S

Print temperature:  PR IT


============

IS command: 
set input function:

 IS = <input#>, <type>, <active>

 Type:

0 GP        Typical usage: to trigger events within a program
1 Home      When active triggers the homing routine as defined by the homing variable (HM)
2 Limit plus (+)    Functions as specified by the limit variable (LM).
3 Limit minus (â€”)   Functions as specified by the limit variable (LM).
4 G0        Executes a program at address 1 upon activation.
5 Soft stop Stops motion with deceleration and halts program
6 Pause     Pause/resume program with motion.

When given "PR IS" command, typical reply
IS = 1, 0, 1
IS = 2, 2, 0
IS = 3, 3, 0
IS = 4, 0, 1
IS = 6, 0, 1

P2a input plug has 7 pins:
1a: input reference
2a: IN1 (42 size not connected)
3a: IN2
4a: IN3
5a: IN4
6a: Analog In  - not avail on Absolute model
7a: Logic Gnd  - not avail on absolute model
