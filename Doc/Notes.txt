* configure IP address
    default is 192.168.33.1
    need to set up laptop to have that subnet to change

* set echo mode to 2  # see Mcode manual 5-41
                      # otherwise all commands would not respond - readback 0 all the time

* Limit connection, at NSLS-II, we use:

input2 = Limit +
input3 = limit -

connections: P2a
pin 1a = input ref (connect to v+)
pin 3a = in2       (LIMIT PLUS)
pin 4a = in3       (LIMIT MINUS)
Limit common to v-
[Reason of not using IN1 is that NEMA17 (LMDxE42.IP20.pdf, pg49, 6.3.3) has Pin2a N/C]

need to set up as ascii commands:
IS = 2, 2, 1
IS = 3, 3, 1 
(this is activate Limit when open).
IS command syntax: 
    IS input IOfunction InputActiveResponse
       input = 1,2,3,4 etc
       IOfunction: 0/generalpurpose; 1/Homing; 2/Limit+; 3/Limit-; see manual MCode_LMM.pdf 5-66 5.1.64 IS <1-4>

driver will read "PR IS" response to determine which inputs are the limits



* For encoder feedback ops
to close loop inside the controller, using hMT technology, set

AS=1;
MRES is the openloop resolution; 51200cts/rev  (256*20)
Note that Encoder is 1000 lines /rev => 4000 cts/rev
But MRES is still using openloop resolution 51200 cts/rev

Or can use AS=2 (variable current)
DO NOT use AS=3, otherwise motor keeps running


* Save to flash with command "S"

* If disconnect motor/controller power, it takes about 20s to re-establish the connection - controller reboot. Asyn autoconnect works.  For "absolute encoder models - with capacitor to save position, it will recover to the old position; For non-absolute models, readback position is zero - in this case, it would be good to set autoconnect to no, and restart IOC manually.


# Running the Holding current

Running Current:  RC=25 (default, 25%), change:  RC=50  PR RC   S
Holding Current:  HC=5 (default 5%), to change: HC=10 PR HC S

============

IS command: 
set input function:

 IS = <input#>, <type>, <active>

 Type:

0 GP        Typical usage: to trigger events within a program
1 Home      When active triggers the homing routine as defined by the homing variable (HM)
2 Limit plus (+)    Functions as specified by the limit variable (LM).
3 Limit minus (â€”)   Functions as specified by the limit variable (LM).
4 G0        Executes a program at address 1 upon activation.
5 Soft stop Stops motion with deceleration and halts program
6 Pause     Pause/resume program with motion.

When given "PR IS" command, typical reply
IS = 1, 0, 1
IS = 2, 2, 0
IS = 3, 3, 0
IS = 4, 0, 1
IS = 6, 0, 1

P2a input plug has 7 pins:
1a: input reference
2a: IN1 (42 size not connected)
3a: IN2
4a: IN3
5a: IN4
6a: Analog In  - not avail on Absolute model
7a: Logic Gnd  - not avail on absolute model
