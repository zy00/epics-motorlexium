* configure IP address
    default is 192.168.33.1
    need to set up laptop to have that subnet to change

* set echo mode to 2  # see Mcode manual 5-41
                      # otherwise all commands would not respond - readback 0 all the time
    EM=2

* Limit connection

input2 = Limit +
input3 = limit -

connections: P2a
pin 1a = input ref (connect to v+)
pin 3a = in2       (LIMIT PLUS)
pin 4a = in3       (LIMIT MINUS)
Limit common to v-
[Reason of not using IN1 is that NEMA17 (LMDxE42.IP20.pdf, pg49, 6.3.3) has Pin2a N/C]

Limit is hardwired in file ImsMDrivePlusMotorController.cpp
 readHomeAndLimitConfig()
		homeSwitchInput = 4;
    	posLimitSwitchInput = 2;
    	negLimitSwitchInput = 3;


need to set up as ascii commands:
IS = 2, 2, 1
IS = 3, 3, 1 
(this is activate Limit when open).
IS command syntax: 
    IS input IOfunction InputActiveResponse
       input = 1,2,3,4 etc
       IOfunction: 0/generalpurpose; 1/Homing; 2/Limit+; 3/Limit-; see manual MCode_LMM.pdf 5-66 5.1.64 IS <1-4>

driver has been modified to use input1=limit+; input2=limit-



* For encoder feedback ops
to close loop inside the controller, using hMT technology, set

AS=1;
MRES is the openloop resolution; 51200cts/rev  (256*20)
Note that Encoder is 1000 lines /rev => 4000 cts/rev
But MRES is still using openloop resolution 51200 cts/rev

Or can use AS=2 (variable current)
DO NOT use AS=3, otherwise motor keeps running


* Save to flash with command "S"

* If disconnect motor/controller power, it takes about 20s to re-establish the connection - controller reboot. Asyn autoconnect works.  For "absolute encoder models - with capacitor to save position, it will recover to the old position; For non-absolute models, readback position is zero - in this case, it would be good to set autoconnect to no, and restart IOC manually.


# Running the Holding current

Running Current:  RC=25 (default, 25%), change:  RC=50  PR RC   S
Holding Current:  HC=5 (default 5%), to change: HC=10 PR HC S
